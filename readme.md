# 🖥️ CodeAlpha Project – Python Mini Tools
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects developed as part of a CodeAlpha/Codelph task series.  
The projects demonstrate practical Python programming skills, including web scraping, basic chatbot functionality, stock portfolio tracking, and a simple Hangman game.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The project consists of four main components:

1. **Stock Portfolio Tracker**  
   - A simple Python program to track investments in a stock portfolio.  
   - Calculates total investment, current value, and profit/loss using manually defined stock prices.  
   - Concepts used: dictionaries, loops, arithmetic operations, and formatted strings.

2. **Web Page Title Extractor**  
   - A script to fetch and parse live static webpages.  
   - Extracts the `<title>` tag using BeautifulSoup with the `lxml` parser.  
   - Concepts used: HTTP requests, HTML parsing, string manipulation.

3. **Basic Chatbot with Predefined Responses**  
   - A console-based chatbot that responds to user input with predefined answers.  
   - Supports a small set of greetings, questions, and a farewell.  
   - Concepts used: dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and user input/output.

4. **Hangman Game**  
   - A simple word guessing game where the player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word.  
   - Tracks wrong guesses and ends the game when the word is guessed or attempts run out.  
   - Concepts used: lists, sets, loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and random selection.
